Welcome to the Wii Shop Channel!<br><br>
Quick info:<br>
<br>
My name is Nathan Boehm. I made this website.<br>
Join my <a href="https://discord.gg/QY3bExzUec" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> for updates. (13+ ONLY)<br>
Subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/NathanBoehm" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> to see the cool videos I make.<br>
If you want to make a YouTube video about the website, feel free to do so. Please put @NathanBoehm somewhere in the description so I can see it.<br>
No, this website doesn't work on the Wii's internet browser. I have no plans of making a version of this for the Wii.<br>
<br>
Finally:<br>
Dear Nintendo,<br>
Don't sue me. I'm aware that abandonware is still technically illegal to pirate, but how else is anyone supposed to play these games? We literally have no means of giving you money to play these legally. That being said, if you politely ask me to take this website down, I will do so without hesitation. Thank you.

<!--(All <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Neh3iv7cUN8" target="_blank">blue text</a> is clickable)<br>
Hello! I'm <a href="http://nathanboehm.com" target="_blank">Nathan Boehm</a>. I've noticed this website has increased in popularity lately. That's awesome!
<br><br>
I would love to hear your story of how you discovered this website. Please do so on my <a href="https://discord.gg/QY3bExzUec" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>. I'm active all the time!
<br>
<br>
If you would like to stay updated on my social media, I spend most of my free time making videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/NathanBoehm" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>. Check it out!
<br>
FOR VIDEO MAKERS: If you make a YouTube video talking about my website, please put @NathanBoehm somewhere in the description! It notifies me when you upload it, and I'd love to see it!
<br><br>
Since this website has reached more eyes, that means I've gotten some very helpful feedback from fans! Here are the two suggestions I've seen the most:
<br><br>
<b>"Support for European Regions?"</b>
<br>
This is the next feature I plan to add! A lot of this new audience is international (which is great to see) so I want to make this website accessible to them. On the game submission form, there's a new question to add the download link to the European version of a game. In the (hopefully near) future, I plan to add an option to switch to European Mode, so many others can use the site the way it was intended!
<br><br>
<b>"It'd be cool to see this website work as a real Wii app!"</b>
<br>
I agree! Unfortunately, I know nothing about Wii development. Thankfully, there's a team who does! While this website will always remain a website, please consider checking out <a href="https://discord.gg/FrYYAcuNF9" target="_blank">RiiShop</a>. It's exactly what you're asking for: A Wii Shop revival on the Wii!
<br><br>
While I'm at it, I might as well plug my video game: <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/soda-drinker-pro-nes" target="_blank">Soda Drinker Pro: NES Edition</a>. If you're a fan of the original soda drinking simulator, you'll love this! Check it out!
<br><br>
<b>One more thing...</b>
<br>
Let's not make this website... <i>Too</i> popular. You know how Nintendo is. I don't want them catching wind of this.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading! Hopefully you'll see some more updates soon!-->
